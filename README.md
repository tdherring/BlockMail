#Running the Frontend of BlockMail:

In order to test the frontend of BlockMail, you will need to use software which simulates a web server on your PC, so that the cookies required for it to work can be stored correctly. I recommend using a Tool named XAMPP to do so:
1.	Download XAMPP for Windows from https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
2.	Install XAMPP using the default installation options.
3.	Open XAMPP and start the Apache server (if not already running).
4.	Go to C:\xampp\htdocs and create a folder named “BlockMail”.
5.	Copy the contents of the “Frontend” folder to the BlockMail folder which you have just made.
6.	Open your web browser, and go to http://localhost/blockmail/
You should now be able to use the BlockMail frontend as intended!
